# Disclaimer
This extension is in a really early state of development. However, the full workflow is implemented but a 'lil buggy thus the import may break in some certain cases. I might introduce some "Send in your anonymized data" functionality for easier error reporting and fixing. I also will write some detailed manual describing what one might do with this extension. 

# Install
